# Contributing to PAI Programs

Thank you for considering contributing to this repository. This project aims to provide clear, educational implementations of fundamental AI algorithms with a focus on object-oriented programming principles.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Create a new issue with a clear title and description
3. Include relevant details such as Python version, error messages, or expected behavior
4. For bugs, provide steps to reproduce the issue

### Submitting Code

#### Before You Start

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix
3. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards

#### Code Standards

**Object-Oriented Design**
- Use classes and objects appropriately
- Follow SOLID principles where applicable
- Encapsulate related functionality

**Code Quality**
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and concise

**Documentation**
- Include docstrings for all classes and functions
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Provide usage examples where helpful

**Python Style**
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Keep lines under 100 characters where reasonable
- Use type hints for function signatures

#### Adding New Algorithms

When contributing a new AI algorithm implementation:

1. Ensure it fits the educational purpose of the repository
2. Implement using object-oriented principles
3. Include clear comments explaining the algorithm
4. Add usage examples in the docstring or as comments
5. Test thoroughly with multiple inputs
6. Update the README.md to include your addition

#### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of your changes
2. Ensure your code runs without errors
3. Test with multiple scenarios and edge cases
4. Create a pull request with a clear description of changes
5. Reference any related issues in your PR description
6. Be responsive to feedback and requested changes
